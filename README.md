# Ion App

An Ionic framework starter with vue & capacitor for developing ios mobile applications.


## Ionic framework

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies.

Ionic Framework is based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and feature improvements over the past versions.

### Environment Setup

To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a Node & npm environment.

```bash
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

### Install the Ionic CLI

Install the Ionic CLI with npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

### Run the App

The majority of Ionic app development can be spent right in the browser using the `ionic serve` command:

``` bash
$ ionic serve
```
